# pdf-structured-data-extractor

This project demonstrates how to extract structured information from PDF documents using a combination of Langchain, OpenAI models, and the DocLing library.  It provides a framework for parsing PDFs and leveraging LLMs to identify and format key data points.

**Key Technologies:**

*   **Langchain:**  Used for orchestrating the data extraction process and interacting with LLMs.
*   **OpenAI Models:** Provides the large language model capabilities for identifying and structuring information.
*   **DocLing:** A library for processing documents.
