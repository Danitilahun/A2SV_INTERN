OPPENHEIMER*Princeton University, USASUMMARYMost texts on writing style encourage authors to avoid overly-complex words. However, a majorityof undergraduates admit to deliberately increasing the complexity of their vocabulary so as to givethe impression of intelligence. This paper explores the extent to which this strategy is effective.Experiments 1–3 manipulate complexity of texts and ﬁnd a negative relationship between complex-ity and judged intelligence. This relationship held regardless of the quality of the original essay, andirrespective of the participants’ prior expectations of essay quality. The negative impact ofcomplexity was mediated by processing ﬂuency. Experiment 4 directly manipulated ﬂuency andfound that texts in hard to read fonts are judged to come from less intelligent authors. Experiment 5investigated discounting of ﬂuency. When obvious causes for low ﬂuency exist that are not relevantto the judgement at hand, people reduce their reliance on ﬂuency as a cue; in fact, in an effort not tobe inﬂuenced by the irrelevant source of ﬂuency, they over-compensate and are biased in the oppositedirection. Implications and applications are discussed. Copyright#2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.When it comes to writing, most experts agree that clarity, simplicity and parsimony areideals that authors should strive for. In their classic manual of style, Strunk and White(1979) encourage authors to ‘omit needless words.’ Daryl Bem’s (1995) guidelines forsubmission toPsychological Bulletinadvise, ‘the ﬁrst step towards clarity is writingsimply.’ Even the APA publication manual (1996) recommends, ‘direct, declarativesentences with simple common words are usually best.’However, most of us can likely recall having read papers, either by colleagues orstudents, in which the author appears to be deliberately using overly complex words.Experience suggests that the experts’ advice contrasts with prevailing wisdom on how tosound more intelligent as a writer. In fact, when 110 Stanford undergraduates were polledabout their writing habits, most of them admitted that they had made their writing morecomplex in order to appear smarter. For example, when asked, ‘Have you ever changed thewords in an academic essay to make the essay sound more valid or intelligent by usingcomplicated language?’ 86.4% of the sample admitted to having done so. Nearly two-thirds answered yes to the question, ‘When you write an essay, do you turn to the thesaurusto choose words that are more complex to give the impression that the content is morevalid or intelligent?’Copyright#2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.*Correspondence to: D.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/Oppenheimer-2006-Applied_Cognitive_Psychology.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='There are many plausible reasons that the use of million-dollar words would leadreaders to believe that an author is smart. Intelligence and large vocabularies are positivelycorrelated (Spearman, 1904). Therefore, by displaying a large vocabulary, one may beproviding cues that he or she is intelligent as well. Secondly, writers are assumed to beconforming to the Gricean maxim of manner, ‘avoid obscurity of expression’ (Grice,1975). If authors are believed to be writing as simply as possible, but a text is nonethelesscomplex, a reader might believe that the ideas expressed in that text are also complex,defying all attempts to simplify the language. Further, individuals forced to strugglethrough a complex text might experience dissonance if they believe that the ideas beingconveyed are simple (Festinger, 1957). Thus, individuals might be motivated to perceive adifﬁcult text as being more worthwhile, thereby justifying the effort of processing.Indeed, there is some evidence that complex vocabulary can be indicative of a moreintelligent author. For example, Pennebaker and King (1999) have shown that thepercentage of long words used in class assignments positively correlates with SATscores and exam grades on both multiple choice and essay tests. However it is difﬁcultto draw conclusions about the effectivenessof a strategy of complexity from this data.The study did not look at how readers of the texts containing the long words perceivedthe authors’ intelligence. Thus, it is possible that although students using complexvocabularies are objectively very knowledgeable, they might nonetheless be perceivedas being less so.Why might we believe that the experts might be correct in recommending simplicity inwriting? One theory that predicts the effectiveness of straightforward writing is that ofprocessing ﬂuency. Simpler writing is easier to process, and studies have demonstratedthat processing ﬂuency is associated with a variety of positive dimensions. Fluency leadsto higher judgements of truth (Reber & Schwarz, 1999), conﬁdence (Norwick & Epley,2002), frequency (Tversky & Kahneman, 1973), fame (Jacoby, Kelley, Brown, &Jasechko, 1989), and even liking (Reber, Winkielman, & Schwarz, 1998). Furthermore,the effects of ﬂuency are strongest when the ﬂuency is discrepant—when the amount ofexperienced ﬂuency is surprising (Whittlesea & Williams, 2001a, 2001b). As such, itwould not be surprising if the lower ﬂuency of overly complex texts caused readers to havenegative evaluations of those texts and the associated authors, especially if the complexitywas unnecessary and thus surprising readers with the relative disﬂuency of the text.Both the experts and prevailing wisdom present plausible views, but which (if either) iscorrect? The present paper provides an empirical investigation of the strategy of complex-ity, and ﬁnds such a strategy to be unsuccessful. Five studies demonstrate that the loss ofﬂuency due to needless complexity in a text negatively impacts raters’ assessments of thetext’s authors.EXPERIMENT 1Experiment 1 aimed to answer several simple questions. First, does increasing thecomplexity of text succeed in making the author appear more intelligent? Second, towhat extent does the success of this strategy depend on the quality of the original, simplerwriting? Finally, if the strategy is unsuccessful, is the failure of the strategy due to loss ofﬂuency? To answer these questions, graduate school admission essays were made morecomplex by substituting some of the original words with their longest applicable thesaurusentries.140D. M.

Using length as a manipulation of complexity allows for asimple, easily replicable word replacement algorithm. By keeping content constant andvarying the complexity of vocabulary, it was possible to investigate the effectiveness ofcomplexity.Participants and procedureSeventy-one Stanford University undergraduates participated to fulﬁl part of a courserequirement. The survey was included in a packet of unrelated one-page questionnaires.Packets were distributed in class, and participants were given a week to complete the entirepacket.Stimuli and designSix personal statements for admissions to graduate studies in English Literature weredownloaded from writing improvement websites. The essays varied greatly both in contentand quality of writing. Logical excerpts ranging from 138 to 253 words in length were thentaken from each essay. A ‘highly complex’ version of each excerpt was prepared byreplacing every noun, verb and adjective with its longest entry in the Microsoft Word 2000thesaurus. Words that were longer than any thesaurus entry, were not listed in thethesaurus, or for which there was no entry with the same linguistic sense were notreplaced. If two entries were of the same length, the replacement was chosen alphabe-tically. When necessary, minor modiﬁcations were made to the essay to maintain thegrammatical structure of a sentence (e.g. replacing ‘an’ with ‘a’ for replacement wordsbeginning with consonants). A ‘moderately complex’ version of each excerpt was createdusing the same algorithm as above, except replacing only every third applicable word.Examples of the stimuli can be found in the appendix.Each participant received only one excerpt. Participants were informed that the excerptcame from a personal statement for graduate study in the Stanford English department.They were instructed to read the passage, decide whether or not to accept the applicant,and rate their conﬁdence in their decision on a 7-point scale.1They were then asked howdifﬁcult the passage was to understand, also on a seven-point scale.ResultsThe data of one participant was discarded due to an illegible answer. Analysis of themanipulation check showed that more complex texts were more difﬁcult to read. (x¼2.9,4.0 and 4.3 for simple, moderately complex and highly complex, respectively). Thesedifferences were reliable,F(2, 68)¼4.46,p<0.05, Cohen’sf¼0.18. For other analyses,acceptance ratings (þ1 for accept,/C01 for reject) were multiplied by conﬁdence ratings tocreate a/C07 to 7 scale of admission conﬁdence. Level of complexity had a reliableinﬂuence on admission conﬁdence ratings,F(2, 70)¼2.46,p<0.05, Cohen’sf¼0.12.1With the exception of the dichotomous admissions decision, all dependent measures reported in this paper areseven point scales ranging from 1¼‘not at all’ to 7¼‘very’.Problems with long words141\\nCopyright#2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

OPPENHEIMER*Princeton University, USASUMMARYMost texts on writing style encourage authors to avoid overly-complex words. However, a majorityof undergraduates admit to deliberately increasing the complexity of their vocabulary so as to givethe impression of intelligence. This paper explores the extent to which this strategy is effective.Experiments 1–3 manipulate complexity of texts and ﬁnd a negative relationship between complex-ity and judged intelligence. This relationship held regardless of the quality of the original essay, andirrespective of the participants’ prior expectations of essay quality. The negative impact ofcomplexity was mediated by processing ﬂuency. Experiment 4 directly manipulated ﬂuency andfound that texts in hard to read fonts are judged to come from less intelligent authors. Experiment 5investigated discounting of ﬂuency. When obvious causes for low ﬂuency exist that are not relevantto the judgement at hand, people reduce their reliance on ﬂuency as a cue; in fact, in an effort not tobe inﬂuenced by the irrelevant source of ﬂuency, they over-compensate and are biased in the oppositedirection. Implications and applications are discussed. Copyright#2005 John Wiley &\n",

      "surprising readers with the relative disﬂuency of the text.Both the experts and prevailing wisdom present plausible views, but which (if either) iscorrect? The present paper provides an empirical investigation of the strategy of complex-ity, and ﬁnds such a strategy to be unsuccessful. Five studies demonstrate that the loss ofﬂuency due to needless complexity in a text negatively impacts raters’ assessments of thetext’s authors.EXPERIMENT 1Experiment 1 aimed to answer several simple questions. First, does increasing thecomplexity of text succeed in making the author appear more intelligent? Second, towhat extent does the success of this strategy depend on the quality of the original, simplerwriting? Finally, if the strategy is unsuccessful, is the failure of the strategy due to loss ofﬂuency? To answer these questions, graduate school admission essays were made morecomplex by substituting some of the original words with their longest applicable thesaurusentries.140D. M. Oppenheimer\n",
